This application is a simple sports scoreboard that was built using HTML5 for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to provide functionality. 
Out of the eight total functions, six are focused on implementing score in 1, 2, and 3 point increments. The remaining two functions are built around resetting the scoreboard, and checking to see if the score is equal to 99. 
If the score is equal to 99, the user will be alerted that the game is over, which team has won, and will have to manually reset the scoreboard using the built-in "Reset Scoreboard" button. 
This is a work-in-progress, and I will be adding in functionality to automatically reset the scoreboard upon one team reaching the score cap of 99 points.
